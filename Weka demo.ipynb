is no escaping the fact however that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation  still the mccann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal it's even better than the organic all-natural brands i have tried  all the varieties in the mccann's variety pack taste good  it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issuemccann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product  real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff one thing i do not like though is mccann's use of thickeners  oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum but this is a convenience product  maybe the guar gum is why after sitting in the bowl a while the instant mccann's becomes too thick and gluey\", \"this is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand  it uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup so not only does it have a better sweetness but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you  great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make mccann's steel cut oats  the apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too  plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart\", \"instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl mccann's instant oatmeal holds its texture has excellent flavor and is good for you all at the same time mccann's

which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes it's all good that's for sure and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular  this variety pack allows different tastes to be explored as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between mccann's and other well-known oatmeals what i personally like about mccann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in america the apples & cinnamon though tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add in my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use  the only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes this is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters but if you're a single person alone -- well love oatmeal\", \"i have mccann's oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from amazon i am able to save almost $300 per boxit is a great product tastes great and very

pass muster with my kids so i probably won't buy it again\", \"good oatmeal  i like the apple cinnamon the best  though i wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste  that could just be me since i like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of\", 'the flavors are good  however i do not see any differce between this and oaker oats brand - they are both mushy', \"i really like the maple and brown sugar flavor the regular is fine with brown sugar added the apples and cinnamon flavor is ok this is a very quick easy and satisfying breakfast and i'll order this brand again but not the variety i'll get all maple and brown sugar\", 'this is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores  there is nothing healthy about it  it is just carbs and sugars  save your money and get something that at least has some taste', \"this oatmeal is not good its mushy soft i don't like it quaker oats is the way to go\", 'got a free package of

an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body  you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and

chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell  i thought i\\'d found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in  the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before  i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping  as the symptoms passed this too was very unpleasant  though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market  the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters thank goodness i\\'d eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their heart\\'s content but others like me can have a

you off  i have been looking for this for a while now not for food science but for something more down to earth  i use it to make my own coffee creameri have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat and honestly i hate to use manufactured \"food\" items  i really don\\'t think they are good for the body  on the other hand i hate using cold milk or cream because i like hot coffeei stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer  i also bought low-fat non-instant milk powder and regular milk powder the non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee  you will have to play with the ratios - i would not do just the heavy cream it made the coffee too rich also i think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\'s own i like mixing 1/3 of each togetherfor flavoring i bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder and caster superfine sugar  i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers  if you wanted you could use a fake sweetner powder instead  i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars i also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom  let it settle for a bit before opening the top thoughthis stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors  i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolate/orange mixall of the ingredients i mentioned are here online  take the time to experiment  maybe you don\\'t use any low-fat milk or don\\'t add any flavorings  it is up to you  also would make great housewarming/hostess giftsi am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great', 'while my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog

sliced fruit then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets they harden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through i\\'ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes to hold a fruit topping in place personally i do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous i

fruit on top of the cheesecake cherries strawberries or sliced mangos are nice but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cakei use a base of sponge cake baked in a shallow form but other bases can be pate sucre  a kind of french pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted straight-sided forms you can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again i prefer pate sucre it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme patisserie which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour  below the fruit and i happen to think these taste bestif you get into baking this glaze is a must-have on the

real hit since i wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if i have garlic for lunch i gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart? and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which

purina they loved the nutro they loved the iams they love whatever we feed themthis review is based on what we their affectionate owners love after a certain age we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods because the catties were fatties we tried a few types of food some evinced no change some made the litter super-stink  some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow itthis felidae has done the trick no problems to speak of it is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose the cats love it the kibble is sized appropriate to chewing and here's the kicker:after feeding the cats felidae their demeanor improved their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly

cat on felidae platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it she's an older cat somewhat overweight and had a grouchy temperament i first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the felidae and left the old food she's now been on just the felidae for about ten days now off the old food entirely and she is a much sweeter happier cat i think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested or something in any case i am a happy purchaser of felidae i don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it clearly mine does\", 'we have three

urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no ut problemsbuster the youngest is still a blob after six months plus on felidae for senior and overweight cats  however the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to felidae  even prissy the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her where before when she was on purina one all she wanted to do was to sleepi think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems it\\'ll be more effectivehowever the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life', \"too much of a good thing? we worked this kibble in over time slowly shifting the percentage of felidae

do not like change when it comes to their food  and they just had to change it without putting it on their label  we noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell  as you will notice

cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment or a loud noise they can stop eating  it depends on the cat  two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight  we took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal  it has been a year since then and they are better  then the formula for this food changedwe started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us  we asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food  it wasn\\'t until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick  right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven\\'t suffered one bit like our dogs havecats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating  anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it  we have 5 rescued and fixed cats none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formulai urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the fda website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal  as with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals and tell me not to buy it  this is just horrible', \"don't buy just a few of

to the heat we prefer the milder mccormick's brand of fajita mix i've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix isif you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind to me it was more than medium hot but not by too muchi gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it you take a plastic bag a couple of tbs of vegetable oil 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes in the meantime it says to stir fry your veggies peppers and onion but i found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and i don't think it affected quality

bit more\", \"a friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at $7/lb in a retail store or a

that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttonyeventually we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until 1 year yeah right

approaching the local costtake carelee\", 'nothing wrong with the product but i sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me in texas i was called a \"baby-mouth\" - not into very spicy-hot foodsfor comparison i\\'m comfortable with tostitos medium chunky salsa 1 can of this milder rotel mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes was still way too hot for me

put up the taste for the results it's got 150mg of caffeine which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters i can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it the sugar is at 9g which isn't horrible i used to drink 4 16oz red bulls a day for the caffeine and this gives me far better energy and is much more

up really early to work out before work and i get super tired by the middle of the afternoon i was drinking one 5 hour energy usually extra strength each day it worked well but gave me a jittery

almost-headache feelingi don't mind the taste--it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mmm and the price is ok on amazon anyway at my grocery store they were almost $3 each yikeand it's organic--so i can feel good about it right? it's all about me feeling good\", 'i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day good stuff', \"i am a energy junkie and i'm not sure if this works or not but what i do know is that the taste is not the greatest i do drink the steaz energy drink and i think i get the same results i like this products because it is  more natural then the others\", 'if you want an organic energy shot your choices are this one from steaz and the assorted flavors from guayaki guayaki yerba mate is actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drinks and they both use sambazon acai so there are some similarities in ingredientsgreat energy burst for 4+ hours on a steaz energy shot

tons of sugar is a no-no and i'm also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are outi tried bazi energy shots and they didn't work as well as steaz and definitely didn't taste as

of either of them this one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better i like them cold for sure my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive it's worth the $[] per shot we normally split them i'm really sensitive to caffeine even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost i would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there you can feel good about putting this in your body i'll be ordering again soon for sure =\", 'i purchased it because it was on sale in terms of the energy it provides it works but the

unacceptable so i asked the nice lady at the counter of my local whole foods market for something that will give me that extra energy i need to get through the dayshe excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle over three hours after drinking whatever that was my brain is still working at unnatural speeds to summarize my experiences: i believe this worksshe did explain that i needed to drink plenty of water with it which i personally feel helped the energy level so if you're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee give this a shot - preferably before you eat anythingwoot\", \"the energy shot truly does work it had a terrible after-taste at first but now that i know what to expect i am getting used to it i always have some water handy as a chaserwhich

caffeinated beverages yay\", \"i've tried 5-hour energy red rain nos and other energy shots  this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect  plus it's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used  sometimes i wonder what i'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands  i purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years\", \"if you're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals this is a great option  the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters\", 'i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious -- i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days; i also hate the taste i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions including fibromyalgia which saps me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done no caffeine jitters even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottleit was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of 12 on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product hah', 'i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all its also the best taste others taste like medicine this one has a tea fresh taste i love it', \"i

dried mushrooms while they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus additionally i find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews to save time and add flavor i sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them really helps meld all the flavors

like 3 days the cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces they were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape first i found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till i opened them the trick is to actually keep them in an air-tight box so that they stay fresh longerthe only negative i can think of is that the price went up abt $500 for the 10lb since i bought them', 'these nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty  they are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can', \"i bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey

organic mint chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream there are only 110 calories  and because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste i use it

only 10 since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water approximately half a cup it's not enough for a good cup of tea so i use two that means that one box is only good enough for

a lot of oil in them chips what i do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off it seems gross that there

which i find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own or you can even share a single bag over lunch the size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are

not too thin so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off  the flavor is tremendous although i wouldn't describe it as thai  it's more of a vague sweet and tangy flavor with a kick and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger  if you like any spice at all these really are not overly spicy so most people can handle them  the fact that these chips

i discovered them when i was in england back in 2000 and quickly became a fan  about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket  i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it  after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to  they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed  so i e-mailed kettle with the following:  \"what happened? i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; it tastes \"cheaper\" i don\\'t know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch? i have been buying only kettle chips for about 10 years now so i am wondering\"  i did receive a reply: \"thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand® chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections and we apologizeour potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste greatthanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag  this really helps when passing on your comments to our staffwe are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand® flavors or nut butters believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same timethanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks  please let me know if i can be of any more help\"  well the next bag was good  since that time i have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost  i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company  so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle  acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand

bagshopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same  these are definitely chips for adults however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips  they are not the strongest flavour i have ever hadthat was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even methese backyard barbeque chips by kettle however have just the right amount of sweetness with honey powder onion and sugar to take the edge of the stonger flavourspaprika chili pepper cayenne pepper and natural smoke flavour of which there is less they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweetenersthe complete list of ingredients of these kettle backyard barbecue chips in the 1-ounce bags and hopefully in the 9 ounce

peppercitric acidcayenne pepperpaprika oleoresin colournatural smoke flavournaturally cooked natural ingredients  the combination is a true taste treatof course as with all ptato chips moderation is the keypotatoes contain a lot of potassiumwhich gives energy and othr good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindneys  the vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil as well as too much starch from the potatoes can hurt the eyes  natural smoke flavour is so yummybut it as well as sugar has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer productionas far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go thiscan be ameliorated a bit by drinking teawhich is good for the eyes  but as far as the potassium energy - good too much -- bad for the kidneys and the sugar and natural smoke flavour too

drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream  it was such a happy accident to find out how to use it  when added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than

a ginger ale is more dry higher in carbonation and has a spicier bite to it vernors has 39 grams sugar per can versus 33 grams per can for schweppes ginger ale neither has caffeinethe recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners they use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use rather than the cane sugar they used to use the down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors many microbrews are using cane sugar again although it costs more to get a better taste vernor\\'s is still aged in oak

use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry additionally when baking make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients

worst frosting we have ever bought it's kind of generous to call it frosting it has more the consistency of rubber cement and since we were in a time crunch we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it horrible experience bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever it spread about as easily as chewing gum stuck to everything it came in contact with and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it on top of all this it didn't even taste good by the time we were done decorating we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family so we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake our cake which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey was used as a centerpiece a really ugly centerpiece that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried\", 'i work in college financial aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students  i used to buy them in the grocery store

has a round full flavor in the middle  doesn't have the complex ending flavors  for me the initial saltiness of bluegrass is a minus and kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus  i prefere kikoman

condition timely and was terrific  definitely a good buy', \"i'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker you'll like this it doesn't taste exactly like either of those but that's the closest analogy for me  the sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind dipped in chocolate with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eatinghere's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks  the packets themselves are really cleverly designed with a little slit cut in the folded part you just grab both sides and pull and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love japanese product design  :  another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the topeach of the packets has 210 calories 90 from fat and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option  it does contain milk wheat soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you then you'll want to pass  it also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to eitheroverall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets so that's quite a few snacks  one note if you live in a hot climate don't order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping  duh  :\", 'the chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother the product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting japan', \"first of all i love the packaging making it heatproof but it wouldn't have been a problem because i ordered it it winter and

i had heard many people rave about a japanese snack called pocky so i figured i would try it out just like the description states its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate i wouldn\\'t say the taste is

2012*****inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****so i decided to restock after i couldn\\'t fight the craving anymore unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through amazon prime what i received was not the picture shown on the front page 2 per pack japanese pocky it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from thailand in my opinion the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back packaging was fine and i ordered in october when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door the sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate the original japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouthpersonally i like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor i also have terrible self control so i buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items i can honestly say that i won\\'t be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because i and my stomach dislike it so much i won\\'t change my original rating because that still holds true for the japanese pocky but if i were to rate only the thailand pocky it would be a 3 the taste isn\\'t \"terrible\" but its definitely not to my liking if possible i will be uploading some pictures of what i received', \"bought these for my daughter's grad party as well as the strawberry she loves these things they're a great product\", 'everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this  it is addicting  that

very slim sticks of biscuity stuff the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping crispness the chocolate flavor a nice non-bitter non-dark generically pleasing choco-taste seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at cons but i prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream very nicethis is by no means a health food it\\'s in the same category as a cookie it\\'s got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients but hey it\\'s junk food we all know it\\'s supposed to be occasional and not habitual in the diet unless you\\'re really prone to binge-eating or can\\'t stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat 3 of them saturated i wouldn\\'t recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes in fact just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effectif you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together like almond joy try the coconut chocolate ones they\\'re really so good oh man hubby says the taste reminds him of the girl scout \\'caramel delights\" cookies which are in turn similar to the old yes yes cookies from the seventies or soanyway if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats or seen footage of cute japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats this is what they were eating : fun treatshowever with this crazy hot summer i\\'d recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall\\'s cooler weather you might get a sticky clumped mess of pocky sticks in this deep summer weather look for local stores that specialize in japanese anime or manga and

was impressed with very asia\\'s packaging i had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer on top of that the package of dessert pocky i ordered in 100 degree

and tasty i used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade the white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periodsi must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact some even come out of the box

can't get enough of this i like that it is organic and contains fruit veggies protein and grains in one tasty meal i wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars\", \"its my daughter's favorite first and foremost  for me i love that i can get lentils there aren't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices\", \"wow i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars the other posters say they notified earth's best about this in august and they are still selling it without checking or recalling no more earth's best for my little guy i am taking my business elsewhere and i am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars they gotta do better than this to get my business\", \"i like the earth's best baby food line because of the organic ingredients amazon has great prices especially if you subscribe and free delivery to your doorstop which is convenient when you're a busy mom my daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods but will eat this one as other reviewers have stated it's a bit runnier that other eb's stage 2 foods so i add some oatmeal to it it's also a bit bland so i add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up as an added bonus it works wonders for her digestive tract she had problems with constipation for about 25 months sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository and then i discovered that this food makes her poop every time i also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber i rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken i wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein\", \"this is my son's favorite dinner best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein 21%  vitamin a 100% and c 30% it is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it love love love this brand and flavor i think i purchased 50 jars so far\", \"i don't know how everyone else got these broken but when i received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap not a single jar was broken  my son loves them and the price was great and i had no issues at all\", \"would be a quality product if it weren't so thin nearly the consistency of soup it just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be\", \"i would love to say that i have the time to make my son's food everyday its not the case honestly i do make it most of the time but some days you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done enter this product before i bought this baby food i read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it its like a dessert yadda yadda yadda the truth is is that yes it has a bit of fruit in it but its not sweet at all the fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet the consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also baby will not choke on it i highly recommend\", \"we love earth's best organic baby food but this is not the tastiest one i've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross but my daughter still eats it just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors it's got a decent amount of protein which is important for us as a vegetarian family\", 'soft smooth texture - my little one devours this oneit is one of the best meat/veg dinners we have found', 'my triplets will not eat this eventhe one who will eat anything the consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon', 'my baby loves sweet potatoes i can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what i wanted to mix in there it was horribly runny like spooning formula into his mouth ick', \"my daughter was not a big fan of baby food especially any with proteins but she did love this one the flavor is just right not too sweet or too savory and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp thus it's a very good first protein to offer and good for picky eaters my nephews and my niece also liked this flavor so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferencessomething i wish i had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other stage 2 earth's best especially for having chicken i added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture and she liked that just fine but it is an extra step however the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems\", 'this is the only food my daughter will eat consistly she really enjoys it the packaging is great never had any broken having ordered 4 times', \"my son loves the rice and lentil jars  it's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars  i have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged\", 'i have twin girls they both loved the vegetable turkey dinner  it was one of their favorite baby foods  great price', \"i normally love earth's best products as does my son however tonight after i'd given him half the jar i thought i would try some since it was a new flavor and i realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it i was appalled  as this is my first child and i don't have any experience with this kind of thing i called poison control they said he would be ok and once i knew he was fine i got really angry i looked it up online and found that earth's best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it don't buy earth's best really disappointing\", \"my son really enjoys earth's best lentil  he eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more  the product shipped very quickly\", \"i introduced my daughter to earth's best organic turkey vegetable dinner at 4 months a bit early but she's advanced as she was 6 weeks overdue  she loved it at first  but i bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite  i've tried some of it as well  of all of them this is also my least favorite\", 'we received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today i always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature i put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds and taste ok when i tasted this i made a face because it was so yucky i added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon to her credit my 8 month old daughter ate some bites but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors i like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein', \"i love the fact that there is turkey being offered this is my son's 2nd favorite dish no issues with it and a good balance of nutrients\", 'only three jars came in a form edible to babies  the rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water  it also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixturepretty disappointing and a waste of money', \"this is one of my son's favorite baby foods  it does have a bit of sweetness but not too sweet  it's more runny than some of the other flavors so we use a deeper spoon with this one or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up\", \"for whatever reason our son really likes this flavor i'm not a fan myself but i'm not the one eating it any time i can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting i'm a happy mom\", \"the rice and lentil dinner is our son's absolute favorite i don't know why but he gobbles this up every time he enjoys most of the earth's best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat anything with too much apple which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar\", \"my 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this oneby far it is her favorite jarred baby food i like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food and i'm not ready to introduce her to meats yeti do subscribe & save which brings the price down to $080/jar that's a fair price - not an amazing deal but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store  the bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - i have to go to whole foods my regular grocery store and target carry earth's best but not this blend my daughter likes it so much though that i would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices it's a good one\", 'i always try the food before i feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good my daughter loves it she gets all excited when i make it for her', \"from 6 month to 12 month my son barely ate any solid food  he was so picky  we tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar  i didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it but i guessed it wrongnow he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater  his current favorite seems to be tofu but he still loves corn zucchini brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this  i highly recommend to try this baby foodalso earth's best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well  my son doesn't really like any snacks from gerber brand but he likes most of the products from earth's best  their foods taste greateven for us adult and so good for you too\", 'little baby picky will only eat this sometimes this one is more watery than the others so keep that in mind reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different so i hope letting you know the consistency and texture help', \"this tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these there is absolutely nothing bad to say about these i know some people have complained about the poor packaging but i believe that must've been fixed b/c i've not had any problems at all -- in fact they securely bubble wrap these then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time\", 'i have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review but they like all the flavors the textures are great and the jars open easily great on the go snack', \"my son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he's now 14 months old and it's one of his favorites unfortunately they don't carry it at the local grocery store they carry other varieties of earth's best; just not this one or his other favorites spinach/potatoes and spaghetti with cheese; they do carry it at some of the whole foods so i buy them there i'm so glad to find them on amazon i get tired of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the storewe use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli small pieces of meat i've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors\", \"my baby loves rice and lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat  if we are going somewhere i won't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold\", 'my daughter loved this stuff it is all natural and made very well  good to mix with other things as they get older too  beats gerber', \"my daughter is outgrowing baby food but

the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds  however the taste is very bland for me as an adult at least after you put the unfinished portion in the fridge it may become sort of

stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food  plastic in baby food? i notified earth's best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing but i am not giving my baby this food any more even though she likes it that's it for us\", 'the earths best he eats the most this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny', \"i'd continue to buy but i'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jarsshattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too\", \"i didn't eat any but my baby liked it she said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in tuscany also i like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste i just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever and if you don't recycle then you and i have nothing in common and you should stop reading here it's not even a hard thing to do anymore nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy you just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day stop being lazy\", \"i just wanted to post here that i

also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras rooti've never had real sassafras tea made with the root so i don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing

my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7  that seemed a little high but i figured i would check online to find the best price  as i started calculating all of the online prices they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count  i would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper  so you don't have to do the math$7 / 38 = 184 per single  online price $27 / 114 = 236 shipping not calculated in  looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69 no sales tax and free shippingsounds like a great deal??

of grains and fruits is similar this cereal is mostly a flake cereal while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all\"real\" muesli is made of rolled not flaked grains; this has pluses and minuses  on the plus side milk does not turn european mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals  on the minus side european mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so ie while you are in the shower or while the coffee is brewing or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side  for those that are concerned about eating processed foods rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones  rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush pressed into flakes fully baked

want to go for cold pressed oils if they\\'re not cold pressed it means they\\'ve been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats which as anything goes can and usually does kill any

coconuts being chopped the meat is cold-pressed unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing nutiva\\'s approach preserves as much of the oil\\'s natural color flavor and aroma giving you the best results for any use\"\"if you don\\'t care about how it\\'s processed it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found

ingredient its ingredients are: cornstarch calcium sulfate* and one of the suggested servings 1 tblsp contains 15% of the \"daily value\" of calcium that makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation on the other hand for persons who must restrict their calcium intake example some persons with kidney stones it can pose a potential problem even danger amazon

amazon to not at least list the correct ingredients and photo of the package so that you do not have to order the product in order to \"read labels\" and find out what you have purchasedi will not buy

crunching rocks most of them spat it out after a few chews left it there this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives these dogs will work for lettuce where is a zero star button?\", 'i ordered both the beef and turkey flavors my dogs would not even take these in their mouths both flavors were  very dry and had no real aroma to them try a small quantity first i  donated the entire order to the humane society', \"this does not reflect on the product but my shi-tzus took them and left them laying on the carpet normally with chicken or turkey snacks they go nutsi donated both containers to the humane society i'd try a smaller quantity for a first order\", \"this is not jerky this is processed hard like a rock very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can't break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat the dogs- who will eat anything- were not impressed it was hard to chew and it sounded like they were crunching rocks where is a zero star button?\", 'my partner is very happy with the tea and is feeling much better since starting to drink itshe has been drinking it both hot normal and iced chilled and likes the refreshing nature of it', 'this tea won an award in the usa and i know why\"mandarin silk loose leaf oolong tea\"  is like the name suggests \"silk\" silk on your tongue  a tea that has a warm relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderfulwell done \"art of tea\"', 'i originally ordered two teas from art of tea - the silver needles and the coconut creme when my package came in they had shipped the coconut creme and mistakenly bundled it with this mandarin silk tea by accident i contacted amazon and they refunded the silver needles and told me i could \"dispose of the mandarin silk oolong as i saw fit\" well since i\\'m never one to turn down tea i chose to dispose of it by well drinking itthis isn\\'t a bad tea first off i don\\'t have too much experience with oolongs but i do like the flavor of this however i don\\'t taste too much of the mandarin it almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea and it has a similar light green/yellow color i drink it with a little honeyall in all it\\'s a decent tea i don\\'t think i\\'ll order it again but i\\'ll certainly finish off this tin', 'these are identical to \"jay\\'s hot chips\" are they made by the same company?  they have a slightly sweet taste with a nice bit of heat definately not overwhelming heat on a heat scale of 1-5 i would give these about a 2  regarding the texture these are not kettle cooked chips so they do not have much crunch they are comparable to regular lays chips  for about $1 a bag they are a great deal', \"i first had these uncle ray's chips a few years ago while traveling out west i tracked them down on amazon and recognized the name they are just as good as i remember: smoky sweet with just enough kick and there's adequate seasoning on all of the chips each bag also has a little story courtesy of uncle ray that usually has some moral message or anecdote they are pretty funny but not intentionally my only problem with these chips is their texture they're a bit thin and there's not much of a crunchy texture otherwise these are good chips and well worth trying out\", 'i am from michigan but have a vacation home in canada i have always been a fan of the primarily canadian product \"ketchup chips\" uncle rays is a brand i\\'ve seen around there frequently since this is such a hard to find product i expected to pay big bucks to buy it online imagine my surprise when i found these chips on amazon for a little over a dollar a bag- cheaper than the retail i would pay in canada unbelievably delicious ps the dill pickle chips are really good too :', \"mine came with stickers to sell them for $159 but they cost more like $125 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up i bought these for myself so that doesn't really matter and they are cheap similar to lay's but cheaper unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips great product great price\", \"i'm not a potato chip addict but sometimes like them as a snacki chose these because i'd never tried them beforethey are delicious zesty slightly sweet and spicyit's like a combination of sweet and tart at once the oils in these chips are better for health it is hard to put the bag downthey are made in detroit michigan and contain no trans fats that's good enough for me try them\", 'these are some of my favorite chips on the planet they are light crisp & not too greasy the flavor is very dilly love that great chips just hard to find', \"these chips are really good they taste better than other name brands they're cheaper too  they aren't too salty like other brands the flavors blend really well just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in once i start eating them it's hard to stop loli will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand not sure if i can state the name brand or not :\", '4 bags of chips were open when i received the shipment i am hoping that the chips wereblew open during shipment in flight  no more chips for me through amazon  otherwisethe chips are good to eat and very salty', \"not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it  interestingly enough they feel more 'gourmet' when eating these the flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese\", 'we have ordered uncle rays bbq chips many times before always been pleased except this order  just not the sameseasoning as usual generally lacked much for taste not sure if they have reduced the seasoning in their processing? but out of case we bought we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already very disappointed with this order', \"i have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since i was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in canada this is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available i recently got back from a trip to montreal where i ate at least a pack a day i decided i really wanted some around and was happy when i found these on amazon unfortunately the flavor is nowhere close to the brands i've tried before there's a sort of smoky barbeque sauce thing going on not that they're as good as bbq potato chips which i love they just don't taste like ketchup i tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me then just threw them all out yuck\", \"i thought they were very good chips delicious  and as soon as i run out i'll be ordering more very soon\", \"after reading all the good reviews on these chips i have to admit i was disappointed perhaps i just ended up with a bad batch but i could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt and i mean black chips in these bags hopefully the other flavors are better but i'm going to stick with other brands from now on\", 'these are hard to find but worth the trouble  very tasty and very reasonably priced  love the product and received very quickly', \"i love uncle ray's potatoe chips they have alot of spice on each chip  they taste spicy with a tang of sweet when i order a box i pass them out to friends who love them my husband my kids and i eat a whole bag at a time  i limit myself to ordering only twice ayear the salt content makes me blow up but i still love them\", 'i love old dutch ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the us and pricey on ebay  i tried herr\\'s but they were dull - very ketchupy but not the tangy-vinigary ketchup bite that old dutch has makes your mouth hurt  in a good way if you eat too many  uncle rays are decent - more of a kick - many \"loaded\" chips which i like still not the addictive bite i love  so - if you love herr\\'s these may be too much for you  if you love old dutch give these a shot  i am still on my quest for something equal to old dutch', 'i confess i was originally looking at a different \"name\" brand but they were out of the salt and vinegar which is the only flavor i eat  i had never even heard of uncle ray\\'s let alone tried them but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping  i am happy to say i was very pleasantly surprised with these chips  somehow or another even though they just seem to be in a normal box when i opened that first bag i had a nice mix of big chips and little chips  the salt and vinegar blend well so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you-- it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar  in any case they\\'re terrific  i was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product but i\\'m very glad i took the chance', 'it\\'s difficult to purchase \"no-salt\" potato chips at most retail stores so i ordered a case of 3 ounce bags of uncle rays  they are great  not oily and they taste great  you get the potato flavor instead of just salt  i\\'ll be buying these from now on', 'we can rarely find these potato chips where we live so i decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings we cannot be happier with the ordering from amazon the chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing excellent and will be ordering again', 'these had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning the first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them what a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money bad uncle ray']\n"
